The raw data has been sourced from Kaggle- titled NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV Shows.
The  various data cleaning operations performed on the dataset are follows-
1) The Headings were made into UPPERCASE
2) Rows containing blank values were identified using (Fn + F5) key combo, then the rows containing them was deleted.
3)Certain cells had special characters like %,@ etc which were filtered and entire row containing these values were deleted for the ease of analysis both from Title,Directors name column, Cast and Description.
4) Show ID column was change to uppercase using delimiter and then joing the columns with a helper column, after that the values were pasted special to delink between helper column and show id column.

P.S. Due care has been taken to clean the dataset however it is prone to error, if such error(s) is/are not noticed, it may be brought to my attention.
Thank You
